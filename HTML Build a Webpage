		<h2>Why would Neuroscientists study dance?</h2>
		<br />
		<p>Dance is one of the oldest traditions that exists within humananity. All cultures develop music and dance as some form of expression, and the meaning and purpose of these dances differ as much as the various genres of music and styles of dance. Music and Dancing seems to be imbedded in our ancestorial past, within the biological makeup of the brain. Cognitive Neuronscience and Evolutionary Psychology have begun to illuminate the impact in neurocognitive development of language and music, it is not far off to assume that dance also has a special place in our brain and cognitiive development. The purpose of this site is to present Neuroscience, Psychology, and Anthropological research on dance within Humanity. If research shows that is is benefical, perhaps we should all go out, let loose, and <b>DANCE!</b> </p>

		<h3>Is Dance "The Next Wave" in Cognitive Neuroscience?</h3>
		By Steven Brown, Ph.D.
		<div>
			<p>In the last 10 years, music's status within <span style="color:red;"><u>cognitive neuroscience</u></span> has moved from being a fringe area to a topic of central interest to neuroscientists. Dance seems poised to be "the next wave" in cognitive neuroscience. And, in fact, dance takes advantage of many of the strides made by music research and combines them with notions of motor control and sensorimotor coupling that have already attracted great interest in neuroscience.</p>

			<p>Dance is the artform in which movement patterns are what are seen as most salient. As with dance, musical production is based on complex forms of movement and rhythmic timekeeping, and yet what matters most for observers of music is not the movement per se but the product of this movement, namely the sound generated by these actions. For dance, by contrast, it is the movement itself that is most salient.</p>

			<p>From the standpoint of cognitive neuroscience, dance represents a fascinating constellation of features: <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/201111/is-dance-the-next-wave-in-cognitive-neuroscience" target="_blank">Continue to Article</a></p>
